# Image Text and Visual Element Extractor

This Python program extracts text and visual elements from an image using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image segmentation techniques. The extracted content is then organized into a simple HTML file with text paragraphs and embedded images.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: Uses Tesseract-OCR to extract text from images.
- **Visual Element Segmentation**: Segments and isolates visual elements from the image using OpenCV.
- **HTML Generation**: Creates an HTML file with extracted text and visual elements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pytesseract
- Tesseract-OCR
